      <h2>Breathing New Life into Old Machines</h2>
      <p>
        The father of the Linux kernel, Linus Torvalds has always been a massive
        proponent of accessible, open-source software. Following that principle,
        Linux has never been easier to install and maintain, and the lightweight
        operating system can seem to resurrect older computers.

      <h2>Why is That?</h2>
      <p>
        Linux does not use as many resources on your machine as Windows, or
        MacOs for that matter. Freeing up all of this extra computational power
        can let your computer run faster. It's even environmentally friendly!
        Changing operating systems would give more use to an old laptop that
        would be in a landfill. Such a waste! Even a potato-tier machine could
        host a website, home server, or many other projects.
